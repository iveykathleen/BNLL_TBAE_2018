Are we capable of predicting lizard location/activity based on field active body temperature alone? Data file contains operative temperature
model temperatures in various microhabitats (shrub, open, burrow), field active body temperatures, observed locations of lizards, and predicted
locations of lizards. Field active body temperature was plotted against OTM temperature and exact location of each lizard was blindly predicted 
based on what temperature the lizard was at any given time in comparison to the available microhabitat temperatures.
